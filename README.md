# tl;dr

A bash script for installing the Sensu software repositories on Ubuntu 14.04.
This script exists purely for the purpose of facilitating [the five minute Sensu
install](https://sensuapp.org/docs/0.22/the-five-minute-install).

## Do not try this at home

There are much better ways to install Sensu (e.g. using [Chef][chef] or
[Puppet][puppet]), so you probably shouldn't try this at home.
